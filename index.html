  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Our project aims to do a realistic water rendering by adding caustics and using Height-Field for surface simulation. Our project is implemented using Unity as the engine and CG shaders to perform calculation for height-field, reflection, refraction and caustics.</p>

  <h2>Changes Made Since Presentation</h2>
  <p>We have implemented the water reflection and refraction correctly in this iteration. We have also changed our pool structure from using 5 separate planes as its walls and floors to using a cube and using a cubemap to sample textures from.</p>
