  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Our project aims to do a realistic water rendering by adding caustics and using Height-Field for the physical simulation of the water surface. Our project is implemented using Unity as the engine and CG shaders to perform calculation for height-field, reflection, refraction and caustics.</p>
  <h2>Cubemap used</h2>

  <p>This is the cubemap we created using Blender.</p>

  <p>The top and bottom view of the cube show the reflection and refraction applied in real time.</p>

  <h2>Changes Made Since Presentation</h2>
  <p>We have implemented the water reflection and refraction correctly in this iteration. We have also changed our pool structure from using 5 separate planes as its walls and floors to using a cube and using a cubemap to sample textures from.</p>
