## Introduction

Our project aims to do a realistic water rendering by adding caustics and using Height-Field for surface simulation. Our project is implemented using Unity as the engine and CG shaders to perform calculation for height-field, reflection, refraction and caustics.

## Changes Made Since Presentation

We have implemented the water reflection and refraction correctly in this iteration. We have also changed our pool structure from using 5 separate planes as its walls and floors to using a cube and using a cubemap to sample textures from.
